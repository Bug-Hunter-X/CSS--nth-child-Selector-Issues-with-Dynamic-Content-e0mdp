The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` selector can produce unexpected results when dealing with dynamic content or elements that are added or removed from the DOM after the page loads.  If you rely on `:nth-child(n)` to style elements based on their position within a parent element, changes to the DOM might cause the styling to become incorrect or inconsistent.
